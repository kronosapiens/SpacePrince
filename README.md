# Space Prince 🪐

Space Prince is an onchain, single-character RPG about identity, attention, and irreversible choice.

Players play as a globally-unique **Prince**, identified by a latitude, longitude, and timestamp.
This position gives every prince a distinct profile, derived from their astrological chart.
Signs map to attributes, which shape a prince's relative strengths and weaknesses.

Players explore the cosmos through a series of increasingly complex procedurally-generated encounters, in which they adopt various _postures_ to earn _permission_ to advance.
Over many runs of the game, princes gain self-knowledge, which unlocks a greater precision of action.
The end goal is _self-awareness_ and the ability to act with skill and agency.

As players play, their Prince NFT evolves visually, reflecting their advancement and history.
The NFT becomes an "enchanted object" and objective proof of the player's time and investment.

## What This Is

- A **fully onchain** game (client UI only)
- A **single-player** game (no decks)
- A **roguelike structure** where failure advances the world
- A **generative NFT** that evolves as a permanent record of play

Progress does not increase power.
It increases specificity.

---

## Core Ideas

- **Identity is irreversible**
  Minting recognizes an identity; it does not create one.

- **Power is cyclical, not hierarchical**
  No build, chart, or strategy is universally dominant.

- **Failure is canonical**
  Death leaves permanent trace and unlocks new understanding.

- **Attention has cost**
  Each run is a deliberate passage, not a retry.

---

## How You Act

On each turn, the player may choose one stance:

- **Think** — seek clarity
- **Wait** — yield to time
- **Fast** — impose constraint

All actions in the game are interpretations of these three.

---

## The Prince NFT

The Prince NFT is:

- The character
- The save file
- The artifact forged through play

It evolves deterministically based on:
- Identity (birth data)
- World interaction
- Failure and persistence

---

## What This Is Not

Space Prince is not:

- A TCG
- A hero collector
- A loot treadmill
- A competitive ladder
- A belief-driven astrology simulator
- A free-to-play engagement machine

It is not trying to entertain.
It is trying to reward attention.
