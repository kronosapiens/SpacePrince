# Space Prince

Space Prince is an onchain roguelike about identity, attention, and irreversible choice.

Players mint a globally unique **Prince**, defined by a latitude, longitude, and timestamp.
This position determines an astrological natal chart — 7 planets, each placed in a sign, house, and dignity state.
The chart is the character sheet: immutable, unique, and full of internal structure the player discovers through play.

Players navigate encounters by choosing which planet to send against each opponent.
Sign relationships determine the terrain — harmonious, tense, volatile — and the player's only action is choosing who to send and when.
Affliction accumulates. Planets combust. Runs end.
Over many runs, the chart reveals itself: new planets emerge, aspects activate, houses illuminate.

The Prince NFT evolves with play — from a single bright point to a full wheel of planets, aspects, and history.
It is the character, the save file, and the artifact forged through attention.

## What This Is

- A **fully onchain** game (client is presentation only)
- A **single-player** roguelike where death advances metaprogression
- A **generative NFT** that evolves as a permanent record of play
- An **art game** grounded in Hellenistic astrology

Progress does not increase power.
It increases specificity.

## Core Ideas

- **Identity is irreversible.**
  Minting recognizes a position; it does not create one.

- **Planet selection is the action.**
  Each turn, the player chooses which planet to send against the opponent.
  Sign relationships determine the outcome. Everything else emerges from chart structure.

- **Affliction is the only resource.**
  No HP, gold, energy, or inventory. A Prince's run state is 7 integers.
  Affliction accumulates, testimony relieves, combustion silences.

- **Aspects propagate with polarity.**
  Internal aspects carry effects between planets — trines attenuate, squares invert, conjunctions fuse, oppositions flip.
  A chart full of squares is harder to play and rewards mastery.

- **Failure is canonical.**
  Death darkens the NFT and unlocks new understanding.
  The chart was always complete — the player is catching up.

## The Prince NFT

The Prince NFT is the character, the save file, and the artifact.

It evolves deterministically from onchain state:
- **Early:** a few bright points on a dark field
- **Mid:** aspect lines appear, connecting planets into visible geometry
- **Late:** the full wheel — planets, aspects, and houses — each carrying its history

Two Princes are distinguished not by rarity traits but by lived history.

## What This Is Not

- A TCG
- A hero collector
- A loot treadmill
- A competitive ladder
- A belief-driven astrology simulator
- A free-to-play engagement machine

It is not trying to entertain.
It is trying to reward attention.
