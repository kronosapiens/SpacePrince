# Space Prince — Economics

## Purpose

Economics in Space Prince exists to **reinforce commitment**, not to extract value or accelerate outcomes.

The goal is not to maximize revenue per player, but to:
- Preserve the sacredness of play
- Discourage trivial or compulsive interaction
- Align cost with attention and effort
- Sustain the world without corrupting it

Every monetization choice must pass a single test:

> **Money may acknowledge commitment.
> Money may never replace interpretation, patience, or restraint.**

---

## Core Principles

### 1. No Pay-to-Win (Stronger Than It Sounds)

Money must never:
- Improve outcomes
- Increase permission
- Influence randomness
- Reduce consequences
- Undo history
- Accelerate understanding

If payment affects *how well* a Prince performs, the system has failed.

---

### 2. Cost as Ritual, Not Transaction

Payments in Space Prince are framed as:
- Recognition
- Initiation
- Commitment
- Passage

They are **ritual costs**, not tolls.

Language must never suggest:
- Retries
- Energy systems
- Attempts
- Punishment for failure

---

## Primary Monetization Channels

### 1. Minting the Prince NFT

**Cost:**
- Flat fee, approximately **$1–$5 USD**
- Fixed forever (no dynamic pricing, no auctions)

**Rationale:**
- Minting is an irreversible act
- Each Prince is globally unique
- Identity is recognized, not generated

The mint fee communicates:
> “This position matters.
> You are taking responsibility for it.”

**Design Rules:**
- No rarity-based pricing
- No early-bird discounts
- No trait-based variation
- No refunds or re-rolls

**Included with Mint:**
- 10 free runs (passages)

This gives new Princes space to begin their journey before the per-run cost applies.

Minting is a vow, not a purchase.

---

### 2. Per-Run Fee (Passages)

**Cost:**
- Flat fee, approximately **$0.25 USD per run**
- Paid only when initiating a run

**Rationale:**
- A run represents focused attention
- Each run permanently alters the Prince
- Cost discourages brute-force optimization
- Silence and waiting remain valid choices

A run is not an “attempt.”
A run is a **passage**.

Players are not paying to try again.
They are committing to another act of crafting.

**Design Rules:**
- No bulk discounts
- No subscriptions tied to runs
- No scaling prices
- No "free retries" after failure
- No advantage conferred by payment

---

## Completion Economics

A Prince is never truly "complete," but there is a point of diminishing returns — call it **maturity** — where most Houses are unlocked, most planetary expressions are available, and the visual artifact has stabilized.

### The Cost Floor

**Rough math:**
- Mint cost: ~$5
- Per-run cost: $0.25
- Runs to maturity: ~1000 (placeholder — actual number is a game design decision)
- **Floor cost for a mature Prince: ~$250**

This floor is intentional and load-bearing.

### Why a Cost Floor Matters

Without a cost floor, mercenary dynamics dominate:
- Bots farm Princes at near-zero marginal cost
- Secondary market floods with cheap "completed" Princes
- Players who craft their own Prince feel like suckers
- The journey becomes something to skip, not experience

The per-run fee ensures that **every Prince requires real investment**, whether played by human or bot.
A mature Prince is a receipt for ~$250 of commitment, regardless of who committed it.

### What the Cost Floor Does and Doesn't Do

**It equalizes monetary cost.**
A bot and a human pay the same $0.25 per run.
Neither can produce a mature Prince for less than ~$250.

**It does NOT equalize time cost.**
A bot can run 24/7; a human cannot.
A bot can produce 10 mature Princes in the time a human produces 1.
This means bots can still flood the market with more volume, even though each Prince costs the same.

**Implication:** The cost floor prevents *undercutting on price* but not *overwhelming on volume*.
If bot operators are willing to sell at cost ($250), they can still dominate supply.
The question is whether they'll bother — the margins are thin.

### Skill as Efficiency

Good gameplay = fewer runs to reach maturity = lower total cost.
Bad gameplay = more runs = higher total cost.

- A masterful player might mature a Prince in 600 runs ($150)
- A struggling player might take 1500 runs ($375)
- A bot, playing optimally within RNG constraints, likely reaches the same efficiency ceiling as a skilled human

**Conservative assumption:** Bots will solve the game.
Given enough runs and compute, a bot can map the decision tree and play optimally subject to dice rolls.
This means skilled humans and optimal bots converge to the same efficiency — call it the "skill ceiling."

**Implication:** Skill provides an advantage over *other humans*, not over bots.
A skilled player can outcompete a casual player on cost.
But a skilled player cannot undercut a bot operator who has already solved the game.

This makes the cost floor even more important: it's not just a floor for bots, it's the floor for everyone playing optimally.
The ~$250 floor applies equally to the best human and the best bot.

### The Secondary Market Question

Who buys a mature Prince, and why?

**Possible buyers:**
- Collectors who want a beautiful artifact without the journey
- Players who want to start at "endgame" content
- Speculators betting on future value

**The tension:**
If the journey IS the game (Siddhartha's path), then buying a mature Prince is buying someone else's enlightenment.
You get the artifact but not the understanding.
The NFT shows scars you didn't earn and Houses you didn't unlock.

This may be fine — not everyone wants the journey, and that's their choice.
But it does mean the secondary market is for a *different product* than the primary experience.

### Should Princes Be Transferable?

The current design assumes transferability, but it's worth questioning.

**Case for transferability:**
- Liquidity increases perceived value
- Players can exit if life circumstances change
- Creates a market that surfaces price information

**Case against (soulbound):**
- Eliminates mercenary farming entirely
- Preserves the journey-as-point narrative
- A Prince truly becomes *yours* — no one else can have it

**Middle ground (ritualized transfer):**
- Transfer is possible but costly or consequential
- Perhaps the Prince is visually marked as "transferred"
- Perhaps some progression is lost in transfer
- Perhaps there's a waiting period or ceremony

This decision is unresolved.

### The Real Design Lever

The cost floor is set by: **(runs to maturity) × (cost per run)**

This is primarily a game design question, not an economic one:
- How many runs should it take to unlock all Houses?
- How quickly should planetary expressions develop?
- What's the pacing of the journey?

The economic implications follow from these decisions.
If maturity takes 500 runs, floor is $125.
If it takes 2000 runs, floor is $500.

Choose the journey length first; the economics follow.

### Summary

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Per-run fee | Creates cost floor, equalizes monetary cost |
| Skill | Reduces runs needed, lowers cost for good players |
| Bots | Pay same per-run cost, but can produce volume |
| Cost floor | Prevents undercutting, doesn't prevent flooding |
| Transferability | Enables secondary market, creates tension with journey narrative |

The per-run fee is a necessary but not sufficient protection against mercenary behavior.
It ensures Princes can't be produced for free, but it doesn't prevent someone from producing many Princes at cost and selling them at thin margins.

The deeper protection is cultural: if the community values the journey over the destination, a "bought" Prince carries less meaning than a "walked" one — regardless of what the NFT looks like.

## What Is Always Free

The following actions must **never** require payment:

- Inspecting the Prince NFT
- Observing visual evolution
- Reading unlocked lore
- Reflecting on history
- Waiting or remaining idle
- Leaving and returning later

Silence is not a billable action.

---

## Explicitly Disallowed Monetization

Space Prince must never monetize:

- In-game items
- Equipment or modifiers
- Cosmetics or skins
- Boosts, accelerators, or rerolls
- RNG influence
- Permission restoration
- Scar removal
- Background entropy reversal

If money can substitute for experience, the design has failed.

---

## Crafting, Not Consumption

Space Prince frames progression as **craft**.

Each run:
- Consumes something real (money, gas, attention)
- Leaves something permanent (scars, entropy, unlocks)
- Cannot be rushed or undone

Over time, players should describe their experience in terms of:
- Time invested
- Runs undertaken
- Attention given

Not dollars spent.

Money should disappear into the background as meaning accumulates.

---

## Secondary / Optional Monetization (Future)

These may be considered **only if they remain strictly non-mechanical**:

- Patronage or sustainer support
- Archival access to historical Princes
- Advanced visualization or inspection tools
- Compiled lore or world-state retrospectives

These must:
- Never affect a Prince’s outcomes
- Never gate progression
- Never replace engagement

---

## Design Guardrails (Non-Negotiable)

- Payment must never feel like punishment
- Payment must never feel like urgency
- Payment must never feel optimal
- Payment must never feel strategic

If a player thinks:
> “I should pay in order to do better,”

the system has been compromised.

---

## Cultural Goal

Over time, players should internalize a different relationship to cost.

Not:
> “How much did this cost me?”

But:
> “How much of myself did I put into this Prince?”

Monetization should fade as meaning deepens.

---

## Final Constraint

> **If money ever becomes more visible than the Prince,
> the game has failed its own premise.**

Monetization exists to support the world—not to explain it.
