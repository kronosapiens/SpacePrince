# Space Prince — Design Invariants

This document defines the **non-negotiable constraints** of Space Prince.

These are not preferences, features, or balance targets.
They are **guardrails**. If a future change violates one of these invariants, the change is wrong—even if it is popular, profitable, or technically impressive.

Space Prince is a coherent system first, and a game second.

---

## 1. Identity Is Irreversible

- A Prince is defined by a unique latitude, longitude, and timestamp.
- There can exist **only one Prince per spacetime coordinate**.
- Identity cannot be rerolled, reset, cloned, or optimized.

Minting recognizes an identity; it does not create one.

---

## 2. The Prince Is the NFT

- There is no separate character save, avatar, or profile.
- The NFT is the canonical record of identity, history, and progression.
- If the NFT changes, the Prince has changed.

The Prince is an object forged through play, not a container for stats.

---

## 3. Progress Is Interpretive, Not Accumulative

- Progress unlocks *ways of acting*, not raw power.
- No linear stat inflation.
- No gear treadmill.
- No build invalidation.

A Prince does not become stronger; they become more specific.

---

## 4. Power Is Cyclical, Never Hierarchical

- All systems exist in closed loops and tradeoffs.
- No chart, build, or strategy is universally dominant.
- Advantage is always contextual.

If something is “best,” it is a bug.

---

## 5. Failure Advances the World

- Death is canonical and meaningful.
- Failure must unlock new understanding, access, or interpretation.
- There is no “try again from nothing.”

Loss is acknowledged, not erased.

---

## 6. Death Leaves Permanent Trace

- Every death must leave an irreversible mark.
- History accumulates monotonically.
- Nothing that records failure may ever be fully undone.

In Space Prince, persistence matters more than success.

---

## 7. The Background Records Entropy, Not Damage

- Death degrades context, not identity.
- The Prince remains intact while the world around them erodes.
- Entropy is visual, permanent, and non-punitive.

A darkened background signifies duration, not weakness.

---

## 8. One Meaningful Action Per Turn

- The player may take exactly one meaningful action per turn.
- No action may be purely cosmetic.
- No action may be free of consequence.

Depth comes from commitment, not throughput.

---

## 9. All Actions Reduce to Think / Wait / Fast

- All player actions are interpretations of:
  - Thinking (seeking clarity)
  - Waiting (yielding to time)
  - Fasting (imposing constraint)
- No new verbs may be added that bypass this framing.

The action space is existential, not tactical.

---

## 10. Randomness Is Explicit and Interpretable

- All randomness must be visible.
- All modifiers must be legible in principle.
- RNG may be shaped, but never hidden.

The player must be able to ask:
> “Given who I am, was this likely?”

---

## 11. The World Is Canon; the Client Is Not

- All meaningful state lives onchain.
- The UI reveals, but does not decide.
- If the client disappears, the world persists.

The chain is not infrastructure—it is authority.

---

## 12. Lore Explains Why Explanation Is Incomplete

- There is no omniscient narrator.
- Lore may contradict itself.
- Lore must never resolve all ambiguity.

Lore relocates mystery; it never eliminates it.

---

## 13. Other Princes Are Traces, Not Competitors

- No ranked ladders by default.
- No numeric comparison of worth.
- Other Princes exist as echoes, warnings, or artifacts.

Social meaning is cultural, not mechanical.

---

## 14. Nothing May Be Purchased to Bypass Interpretation

- Money may not accelerate understanding.
- Money may not undo history.
- Money may not substitute for attention.

If payment replaces commitment, the system has failed.

---

## 15. The Game Must Respect Silence

- Waiting is a valid action.
- Inaction is not failure.
- Not playing for a time must not be punished.

Space Prince must never demand constant engagement.

---

## 16. There Is No “Win Screen”

- No final victory condition.
- No completion percentage.
- No definitive ending.

At most, there is quiet, unreadability, or saturation.

---

## 17. Beauty Emerges from Use, Not Rarity

- Visual evolution reflects history, not traits.
- There are no rarity tables.
- There are no cosmetic-only upgrades.

A Prince is beautiful because it has been lived with.

---

## 18. If Something Feels Explained, It Is Wrong

- Systems should be legible but not exhausted.
- Understanding should deepen, not conclude.
- Mystery should shrink locally and grow globally.

Clarity must never become closure.

---

## Closing Constraint

> **Nothing in Space Prince should try to entertain the player.
> It should try to notice whether they stayed.**

Any feature that violates this is out of bounds.
