# Space Prince — Permission

## Overview

Space Prince has exactly **one primary resource**:

> **Permission**

Permission represents what the world allows the Prince to do, see, or interpret at any given moment.
It is not a currency, not a meter, and not a stat. It is a relationship between the Prince and the cosmos.

All other apparent resources—clarity, momentum, entropy, initiative—are **expressions or consequences of permission**, not parallel systems.

If Space Prince ever feels like it has multiple primary resources, something has gone wrong.

---

## Design Intent

Permission exists to replace conventional game resources (health, mana, stamina, gold) with something that:

- Aligns with irreversible identity
- Makes failure meaningful without being punitive
- Encourages interpretation over optimization
- Can be represented onchain without grind or inflation
- Feels mythic rather than transactional

The player does not *spend* permission.
They **retain**, **lose**, **narrow**, or **reconfigure** it.

---

## What Permission Is Not

Permission is explicitly **not**:

- Health
- Energy
- Cooldowns
- Skill points
- Time
- Currency
- Progression XP

If a mechanic can be expressed as “you ran out,” it is probably not permission.

---

## What Permission Is

Permission is:

- **Access** — which actions, interpretations, or paths are available
- **Standing** — how the world currently responds to the Prince
- **Latitude** — how much deviation or risk is tolerated
- **Legibility** — what the Prince is allowed to perceive or know

Permission is contextual, situational, and asymmetric.

The Prince may lose permission in one domain while gaining it in another.

---

## Permission and Failure

Failure is the primary way permission changes.

On failure:
- Some permissions are revoked
- Other permissions may be granted
- Certain approaches may stop working
- New interpretations may become available

This is never framed as punishment.

The correct player interpretation is not:
> “The game took something from me.”

But:
> “The world no longer responds to this approach.”

---

## Permission and Think / Wait / Fast

The three core actions are direct expressions of how the Prince negotiates permission.

### Think
- Clarifies what permission currently allows
- Reveals constraints, tendencies, or likely outcomes
- Does not create new permission
- Trades tempo for legibility

Thinking helps the Prince understand the shape of permission, not expand it.

---

### Wait
- Preserves existing permission
- Allows the world to act first
- May reconfigure or soften constraints
- Sometimes restores access indirectly

Waiting respects permission by refusing to force it.

---

### Fast
- Voluntarily surrenders permission
- Narrows future options in exchange for intensity
- Forces resolution rather than deferral
- Often irreversible in effect

Fasting converts permission into meaning.

---

## Visibility of Permission

Permission is **never displayed as a number or bar**.

The player learns permission through:
- Which options appear or disappear
- Which actions resolve cleanly or fail abruptly
- Lore fragments that acknowledge allowance or refusal
- Changes in world response

Permission must always be *legible in principle*, but never exhaustively enumerated.

---

## Onchain Representation

Onchain, permission is represented through:
- Flags
- Access gates
- Branch eligibility
- Unlockable interpretations
- State-dependent action availability

There is no global “permission score.”

Permission is always specific:
- To a context
- To a layer
- To a moment

---

## Entropy Is Not Permission

The darkening background (death entropy) records **cost**, not capacity.

- Entropy accumulates
- Permission fluctuates

A Prince with high entropy may still have broad permission.
A Prince with low entropy may find their options sharply constrained.

These systems must never collapse into one another.

---

## Design Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- Permission must never feel grindable
- Permission must never regenerate on a timer
- Permission must never be purchasable
- Permission loss must always be interpretable
- Permission gain must feel *noticed*, not rewarded

If permission ever resembles stamina, the design has failed.

---

## Lore Alignment

In-world language may reference permission obliquely:

- “You are no longer permitted to proceed.”
- “This approach is no longer acknowledged.”
- “You may remain.”
- “You may return differently.”

Lore should describe **allowance**, not authority.

The cosmos does not judge.
It responds.

---

## Cultural Goal

Over time, players should internalize a different question than in most games.

Not:
> “Do I have enough resources to do this?”

But:
> “Am I still allowed to approach the world this way?”

That question is the heart of Space Prince.

---

*Permission is not power.
It is the condition under which power is allowed to matter.*
