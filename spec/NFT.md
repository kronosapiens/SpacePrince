# Space Prince — The Prince NFT

## Overview

In Space Prince, the NFT is not a cosmetic wrapper around a game character.
It is the **canonical object** through which identity, memory, and progression are expressed.

The Prince NFT functions simultaneously as:

1. **A save file** — a complete, auditable record of the Prince’s state
2. **An enchanted object** — forged through play, marked by effort and failure
3. **A generative artifact** — a visual system that evolves deterministically over time

The NFT is not something you decorate.
It is something you **become responsible for**.

---

## Design Intent

The Prince NFT exists to solve a specific problem in both games and NFTs:

> How do you make a persistent digital object feel *earned*, *irreversible*, and *meaningful* over time — without turning it into a commodity or a flex?

The answer in Space Prince is:
- Identity is immutable
- Change is rule-bound
- History is visible
- Progress is interpretive, not accumulative

The Prince NFT is meant to feel less like a profile picture and more like:
- A talisman
- An astrolabe
- A living diagram
- A ritual object that records its use

---

## Ontological Status

The Prince NFT is **the Prince**.

There is no separate character save, avatar, or progression object.
All canonical state is reflected through the NFT.

If the NFT exists, the Prince exists.
If the NFT changes, the Prince has changed.

## Singularity

Each Prince corresponds to a unique position in spacetime.

Once a Prince is minted for a given latitude, longitude, and timestamp, that Prince is **globally unique and non-replicable**.

No alternative versions, re-rolls, or parallel instances can exist.

The Prince NFT is not a copy of an idea.
It is the canonical artifact associated with that position.

---

## Visual Philosophy

The Prince is not depicted as a human figure.

Instead, the visual language draws from:
- Star charts
- Sigils
- Ritual diagrams
- Instruments
- Architectural cosmology

The artifact should feel:
- Abstract but legible
- Ancient but computational
- Personal without being narcissistic

Two Princes should be immediately distinguishable — not by rarity traits, but by **lived history**.

---

## Visual Grammar

To avoid arbitrariness, the visual system mirrors the mechanical structure of the game.

### 1. Immutable Core (Birth Identity)

Derived **only** from the original mint inputs:
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Timestamp

These elements never change.

They determine:
- Base geometry or topology
- Fundamental symmetry or asymmetry
- Primary color harmonics
- Initial orbital or spatial layout

This ensures:
- Identity is permanent
- Minting matters
- The natal chart is always visible in some form

---

### 2. Evolutionary Layers (Progress & Interpretation)

These layers evolve over time, governed by strict rules.

#### A. Houses → Structural Expansion

Unlocking Houses adds **structure**, not decoration:
- Rings
- Chambers
- Axes
- Compartments

This visually communicates:
> “This Prince now acts in more domains.”

Structure reflects integration.

---

#### B. Planets → Motion & Behavior

Planets manifest as animated entities:
- Orbiting glyphs
- Pulses
- Waves
- Rhythmic distortions

Aspects modify:
- Orbit shape
- Synchronization
- Interference patterns
- Temporal rhythm

Examples:
- Saturn dominance → slow, heavy, recursive motion
- Mercury dominance → flicker, branching, echo
- Moon influence → cyclical, reactive variance

Planets express *how* the Prince acts.

---

#### C. Death & Scars → Irreversible Marks

Death produces **permanent visual scars**.

Scars are:
- Integrated into the artifact
- Never removed
- Never purely cosmetic

Examples:
- Fractured geometry
- Darkened regions
- Cracks or voids
- Missing segments replaced by absence

These marks communicate:
> Failure is metabolized, not erased.

A scarred Prince is not weaker — it is more specific.

### Death as Entropy (Background Degradation)

Each time a Prince dies, a single pixel in the NFT’s background permanently transitions from light to dark. Over time, these changes accumulate into a subtly pixelated, darkened field that records the Prince’s history of failure and persistence. This background degradation is monotonic and irreversible: no pixel may ever be restored once darkened. The foreground structure of the Prince—its geometry, motion, and identity—remains intact, while the surrounding context slowly erodes. This design treats death not as damage to the Prince, but as entropy in the world around them, visually encoding attention spent and history accumulated. A heavily darkened background signifies not weakness or loss, but duration, specificity, and having stayed long enough for possibility to give way to memory.

---

### 3. Temporary States (Run-Specific)

During an active run, the NFT may:
- Glow
- Shift hue
- Distort
- Animate more intensely

These effects are:
- Ephemeral
- Clearly temporary
- Receding after the run ends

This preserves the distinction between:
- Who the Prince is
- What the Prince is currently attempting

---

## Evolution Rules

The NFT only evolves when **meaningful state changes occur**.

### Valid Evolution Triggers
- House unlocks
- Planetary expression unlocks
- Aspect reinterpretations
- Death scars
- Major world thresholds

### Explicit Non-Triggers
- Individual combat actions
- Minor choices
- Repeated grinding
- Time passage alone

Change must be **readable** and **earned**.

---

## Determinism & Onchain Rendering

The Prince NFT must be:
- Fully deterministic from onchain state
- Regenerable from scratch
- Auditable by anyone

The rendered image is a **pure function** of:
- Birth data
- Unlocked systems
- Recorded scars
- World flags

This ensures:
- Long-term persistence
- No broken metadata
- No reliance on offchain storage for canon

---

## Social Meaning & Interpretation

Because the Prince is abstract and symbolic:
- Meaning is not prescribed
- Interpretation is social

Observers may notice:
- Depth vs simplicity
- Scar patterns
- Structural completeness
- Planetary dominance

This enables:
- Lore emergence
- Reputation without rankings
- Cultural reading without metrics

Princes become *objects of conversation*, not comparison.

---

## Transfer, Ownership, and Consequence

The Prince NFT is **not designed for frictionless trading**.

If transfer is allowed at all, it should be:
- Ritualized
- Explicitly acknowledged in-world
- Potentially destructive to continuity

Possible models:
- Abdication (original player relinquishes claim)
- Succession (new steward inherits a changed Prince)
- Non-transferability (soulbound)

This decision is intentionally unresolved.

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

The Prince NFT must never become:
- A rarity spreadsheet
- A cosmetic skin
- A speculation vehicle
- A flex object
- A detachable “asset”

Progress cannot be purchased.
Beauty cannot be bought.
History cannot be reset.

---

## Why This Matters

The Prince NFT is designed to demonstrate a different use of NFTs:

Not ownership of *things*, but stewardship of *process*.

It is:
- Proof of attention
- Evidence of persistence
- A record of disciplined play

A Prince that exists could not exist otherwise.

---

## Open Questions

- Can a Prince ever be “complete,” or only asymptotic?
- Can neglect visibly erode or fade the artifact?
- Can scars unlock new forms of beauty?
- Should viewers be able to toggle historical layers?
- Is there a final, unreadable state?

---

*The Prince is not a picture of a character.
It is the character, slowly written into form.*
