# Space Prince — Lore

## Purpose of Lore

Lore in Space Prince is not backstory, flavor, or exposition.

It exists to:
1. Provide **symbolic coherence** to mechanics
2. Reward **attention**, not completion
3. Create **interpretive surface area** for players to discuss, disagree, and myth-make

Lore should never fully explain the world.
It should explain **why explanation is incomplete**.

> The cosmos already exists.
> Nothing is revealed except what the Prince becomes permitted to notice.

## Core Lore Principles

### 1. No Omniscient Authority
There is no authoritative narrator, codex, or canonical voice.

All lore is:
- Fragmented
- Situated
- Biased
- Potentially contradictory

Canon exists at the level of **facts and state**.
Interpretation belongs to the player.

---

### 2. The Prince Is Not a Person

In Space Prince, the Prince is **not** a hero, chosen one, or individual in the conventional sense.

> The Prince is a position in the cosmos -- a point of view.
> A locus where forces converge and must be interpreted.

Different sources may disagree on:
- Whether Princes are born, appointed, or discovered
- Whether there are many Princes or only one, perceived differently
- Whether Princes persist beyond death

All such disagreements are intentional.

### 3. Structure Before Story

Lore is organized around **cosmological structures**, not events.

Primary structures:
- Elements
- Signs
- Planets
- Houses
- Aspects
- Fixed Stars

Lore answers questions like:
- What *kind* of thing is a Planet?
- What does it mean to “unlock” a House?
- Why do Aspects constrain action?
- Why does death reveal more instead of less?

Narrative emerges from interaction with these structures, not from a timeline.

### Singularity of the Prince

No two Princes may occupy the same position.

Some texts claim this is a law of the cosmos.
Others suggest it is merely a consequence of attention.

Regardless, once a Prince is recognized, that position cannot be recognized again.

## Lore Unlocking System

Lore unlocks **in parallel** with mechanical progression.

### Unlock Triggers
Lore fragments may unlock when:
- A House is unlocked
- A Planet’s expression changes
- The Prince dies in a specific way
- A world threshold is crossed
- A repeated pattern of behavior is detected

### Principles
- No lore dumps
- No encyclopedias
- No completion tracking

Fragments are:
- Short
- Revisited over time
- Sometimes altered after death

A fragment read early may later reappear with one word changed.
That change is meaningful.

---

## Death as a Lore Engine

Death is the primary mechanism for lore progression.

When the Prince dies:
- Previously unread fragments may appear
- Previously read fragments may change
- A Planet may comment
- A House may reinterpret itself

Death does not reveal truth.
It reveals **permission**.

---

## Writing Style Guidelines

Lore voice should be:
- Formal but restrained
- Confident without explanation
- Precise but incomplete

Avoid:
- Proper-noun overload
- Epic wars or timelines
- Villains or antagonists
- “As you know…” exposition

Prefer:
- Aphorisms
- Instructions
- Observations
- Disagreements between sources

# Sample Lore Texts

The following samples establish tone, not canon.

---

## Sample: A Planet's Voice (Saturn)

> *You ask what I am.*
>
> *I am the reason nothing arrives all at once.*
>
> *Where I am strong, things endure.
> Where I am absent, things collapse quickly and are mistaken for freedom.*
>
> *You call me restriction.
> You are not wrong.*
>
> *But tell me: what survives without a shape it cannot escape?*

---

## Sample: Contradictory Creation Myths

**Fragment A (Early Game)**

> *The cosmos was assembled.
> The Signs were arranged, the Elements separated, the Planets set into motion.
> Only afterward was the Prince introduced, so that something might observe what had been done.*

**Fragment B (Later Unlock)**

> *The cosmos was never assembled.
> The Prince appeared, and the Signs learned to distinguish themselves.
> The Planets began to move only when something could be delayed.*

Both fragments coexist.
Neither is marked as false.

---

## Sample: Fragment That Changes After Death

**Initial Version**

> *The Prince does not move through the Houses.*

**After a Death Unlock**

> *The Prince does not move through the Houses.
> The Houses move when the Prince stays.*

---

## The Prince NFT as Lore

The Prince NFT is itself a lore document.

Its:
- Structure
- Motion
- Scars
- Asymmetries

…are records of interpretation.

The game does not explain these marks.
Players will.

Lore exists to make those explanations *plausible*, not correct.

---

> *Lore is not what the world says about itself.
> It is what the world permits you to overhear.*
