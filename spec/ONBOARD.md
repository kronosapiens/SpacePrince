# Space Prince — First Ten Minutes

This document describes the **first ten minutes of player experience** in Space Prince.

It is not a tutorial flow and not a UI spec.
Its purpose is to define the *emotional arc* and *conceptual clarity* of the opening experience.

The primary goal of the first ten minutes is:

> **To make the player feel that something irreversible has just happened —
> and that the world is now paying attention.**

---

## Minute 0–1: Arrival

The player enters a minimal interface.

There is:
- No music, or a low, distant tone
- No characters
- No menu of options

Only a single line of text:

> *A position has not yet been recognized.*

Below it, a single action:

> **Recognize a Position**

No explanation is given.

This framing establishes:
- Discovery, not creation
- Seriousness, not playfulness
- A sense of threshold

---

## Minute 1–3: Recognition (Minting)

The player is prompted to input:
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Timestamp

The interface does not suggest “good” or “bad” values.
There are no warnings about rarity, traits, or outcomes.

As values are entered, subtle visual shifts occur:
- Geometry stabilizes
- A faint structure begins to form
- Motion suggests alignment, not generation

Before confirmation, a single warning appears:

> *This position may only be recognized once.*

> *If it has already been recognized, you will not be permitted to proceed.*

The player must explicitly confirm.

This is the moment of commitment.

---

## Minute 3–4: Confirmation

On confirmation:
- There is a short delay
- No loading bar
- No animation of “minting”

Then:

> *The position has been recognized.*

The Prince NFT appears for the first time.

It is:
- Abstract
- Incomplete
- Quiet
- Clearly not “finished”

No stats are shown.
No labels are shown.
No explanation is offered.

The object is presented as a **thing**, not a character.

---

## Minute 4–5: First Address

A voice appears — not in dialogue form, but as a fragment:

> *You will not be instructed.*

> *You will be observed.*

The player is given a single option:

> **Proceed**

This establishes the tone:
- No tutorial voice
- No guidance masquerading as lore
- No sense of being “chosen”

---

## Minute 5–7: First Action

The player enters the first space: **The Ascendant**.

This space contains:
- A single encounter
- One visible opposition
- One visible choice

The interface makes clear:
- You may act
- You may wait
- You may withdraw

The system communicates (visually or textually):
> *Only one action may be taken.*

The player chooses an action.

A visible roll occurs.
Modifiers are shown, but minimally explained.

The outcome resolves.

Whether the outcome is favorable or not, the result is **legible**.

---

## Minute 7–8: Consequence

The consequence is small but real.

Examples:
- A subtle change to the Prince NFT
- A new motion appears
- A structure shifts slightly

A fragment appears:

> *This was noticed.*

The player is not praised.
They are not punished.
They are acknowledged.

---

## Minute 8–9: Failure (Likely, and Intentional)

The second encounter is harder.

Most players will fail here.

Failure is not dramatized.
There is no explosion, no death animation.

Instead:

> *You are no longer permitted to proceed in this direction.*

The screen darkens slightly.

The Prince NFT changes again.
A visible mark appears — small, but permanent.

---

## Minute 9–10: Aftermath

A new interface appears.

It contains:
- The Prince NFT (now visibly altered)
- A new option that did not exist before
- A short fragment of text

Example:

> *Understanding does not arrive intact.*

> *You may return.*

> *You may return differently.*

Options:
- **Begin Another Passage**
- **Remain and Observe**

There is no “Game Over.”
There is no restart button.
There is no encouragement to optimize.

The player understands:
- This will take time
- This cannot be rushed
- Something has already been written

---

## What the Player Should Feel

By the end of ten minutes, the player should feel:

- Curiosity
- Slight unease
- A sense of responsibility
- A desire to see what happens if they continue

They should **not** feel:
- Confident
- Skilled
- In control
- Explained to

The game has not asked for mastery.
It has asked for attention.

---

## Non-Goals of the First Ten Minutes

The opening does **not** attempt to:
- Explain all systems
- Teach optimal play
- Establish power fantasy
- Showcase visual maximalism

If a player says:
> “I don’t fully understand this yet, but I want to,”

…the opening has succeeded.

---

## Design Invariants Established Here

The first ten minutes must establish, permanently:

- Identity is irreversible
- The world responds to action and failure
- Progress is not linear
- The Prince is an object, not an avatar
- Lore is permissioned, not delivered

Everything that follows must honor these invariants.
