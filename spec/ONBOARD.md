# Space Prince — First Ten Minutes

*The emotional arc and conceptual clarity of the opening experience.*

The primary goal of the first ten minutes is:

> **The player mints an identity, watches it respond to the world, and then makes their first real choice.**

---

## Minute 0–1: Arrival

A minimal interface.
No music, or a low distant tone.
No characters, no menu.

A single line:

> *A position has not yet been recognized.*

A single action:

> **Recognize a Position**

No explanation.
This framing establishes discovery, not creation.

---

## Minute 1–3: Recognition (Minting)

The player inputs:
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Timestamp

No guidance about "good" or "bad" values.
As values are entered, a faint structure begins to form — geometry stabilizing, not generating.

Before confirmation:

> *This position may only be recognized once.*

The player confirms.
This is the moment of commitment.

---

## Minute 3–4: The Prince Appears

A short delay.
No loading bar, no mint animation.

> *The position has been recognized.*

The Prince NFT appears.
It is sparse — a single bright point (the Moon) on a dark field.
The rest of the chart is potential, not yet revealed.

No stats, no labels, no explanation.
The Moon's sign is visible — this is who you are, for now.

---

## Minute 4–5: The Moon Speaks

A fragment appears — the Moon's voice, in its register (reflective, shifting, intimate):

> *Something has changed. You are being observed.*

The Moon's planetary color tints the screen.
The player is given a single option:

> **Begin**

---

## Minute 5–7: First Encounter (Moon Only)

An opponent planet appears.
The sign relationship between the opponent's planet and the player's Moon is visible — the terrain.

The player has no choice to make.
Moon is their only planet.
Moon responds automatically.

The interaction resolves:
- The sign relationship determines the character (harmonious, tense, volatile)
- Affliction or testimony flows to the Moon
- The Moon's voice speaks a brief fragment reflecting the outcome

This encounter is **observation, not strategy**.
The player watches how their Moon behaves on this terrain.
They begin to feel what a trine means vs. what a square means.

The encounter is 1 turn.
It ends.

---

## Minute 7–8: Mercury Emerges

After the first encounter, a second point of light appears on the chart.

> *Mercury makes its appearance.*

Mercury's voice speaks — quick, ambiguous, playful:

> *Now there are two of us. Which will you send?*

The NFT has changed.
Two planets are visible.
The chart is no longer a single point — it has begun to take shape.

---

## Minute 8–10: Second Encounter (First Real Choice)

A new opponent planet appears.
The sign relationships between the opponent and **both** the player's Moon and Mercury are visible.

For the first time, the player chooses: **Moon or Mercury?**

The terrain is different for each.
Maybe Moon makes a square (harsh) and Mercury makes a trine (smooth).
Or the reverse.
The choice is legible — the player can see what each matchup means, because they just watched Moon interact a moment ago.

The encounter is 2 turns.
The player sends one planet, then the other (or the same one twice, at the cost of concentrated affliction).

After resolution, the Moon and Mercury may have taken affliction.
The player sees the consequence: their planets are no longer fresh.
Something has been written.

## What the Player Has Learned

By the end of ten minutes, without a single tutorial screen:

- **Identity is irreversible** — the mint happened once, the chart is theirs
- **Sign relationships are the terrain** — they watched Moon interact and saw the outcome differ by terrain
- **Planet selection is the choice** — they chose between Moon and Mercury and saw it matter
- **Affliction accumulates** — their planets are no longer at zero
- **The chart is alive** — it started as one point and already has two, with more implied

The player doesn't understand the full system yet.
But they understand the *feel* — choose a planet, face the terrain, live with the result.

If they say:
> "I want to see what the third planet does,"

…the opening has succeeded.
