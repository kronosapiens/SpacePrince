# Space Prince — Monetization

## Purpose

Monetization in Space Prince exists to **reinforce commitment**, not to extract value or accelerate outcomes.

The goal is not to maximize revenue per player, but to:
- Preserve the sacredness of play
- Discourage trivial or compulsive interaction
- Align cost with attention and effort
- Sustain the world without corrupting it

Every monetization choice must pass a single test:

> **Money may acknowledge commitment.
> Money may never replace interpretation, patience, or restraint.**

---

## Core Principles

### 1. No Pay-to-Win (Stronger Than It Sounds)

Money must never:
- Improve outcomes
- Increase permission
- Influence randomness
- Reduce consequences
- Undo history
- Accelerate understanding

If payment affects *how well* a Prince performs, the system has failed.

---

### 2. Cost as Ritual, Not Transaction

Payments in Space Prince are framed as:
- Recognition
- Initiation
- Commitment
- Passage

They are **ritual costs**, not tolls.

Language must never suggest:
- Retries
- Energy systems
- Attempts
- Punishment for failure

---

## Primary Monetization Channels

### 1. Minting the Prince NFT

**Cost:**
- Flat fee, approximately **$1–$5 USD**
- Fixed forever (no dynamic pricing, no auctions)

**Rationale:**
- Minting is an irreversible act
- Each Prince is globally unique
- Identity is recognized, not generated

The mint fee communicates:
> “This position matters.
> You are taking responsibility for it.”

**Design Rules:**
- No rarity-based pricing
- No early-bird discounts
- No trait-based variation
- No refunds or re-rolls

Minting is a vow, not a purchase.

---

### 2. Per-Run Fee (Passages)

**Cost:**
- Flat fee, approximately **$0.25 USD per run**
- Paid only when initiating a run

**Rationale:**
- A run represents focused attention
- Each run permanently alters the Prince
- Cost discourages brute-force optimization
- Silence and waiting remain valid choices

A run is not an “attempt.”
A run is a **passage**.

Players are not paying to try again.
They are committing to another act of crafting.

**Design Rules:**
- No bulk discounts
- No subscriptions tied to runs
- No scaling prices
- No “free retries” after failure
- No advantage conferred by payment

---

## What Is Always Free

The following actions must **never** require payment:

- Inspecting the Prince NFT
- Observing visual evolution
- Reading unlocked lore
- Reflecting on history
- Waiting or remaining idle
- Leaving and returning later

Silence is not a billable action.

---

## Explicitly Disallowed Monetization

Space Prince must never monetize:

- In-game items
- Equipment or modifiers
- Cosmetics or skins
- Boosts, accelerators, or rerolls
- RNG influence
- Permission restoration
- Scar removal
- Background entropy reversal

If money can substitute for experience, the design has failed.

---

## Crafting, Not Consumption

Space Prince frames progression as **craft**.

Each run:
- Consumes something real (money, gas, attention)
- Leaves something permanent (scars, entropy, unlocks)
- Cannot be rushed or undone

Over time, players should describe their experience in terms of:
- Time invested
- Runs undertaken
- Attention given

Not dollars spent.

Money should disappear into the background as meaning accumulates.

---

## Secondary / Optional Monetization (Future)

These may be considered **only if they remain strictly non-mechanical**:

- Patronage or sustainer support
- Archival access to historical Princes
- Advanced visualization or inspection tools
- Compiled lore or world-state retrospectives

These must:
- Never affect a Prince’s outcomes
- Never gate progression
- Never replace engagement

---

## Design Guardrails (Non-Negotiable)

- Payment must never feel like punishment
- Payment must never feel like urgency
- Payment must never feel optimal
- Payment must never feel strategic

If a player thinks:
> “I should pay in order to do better,”

the system has been compromised.

---

## Cultural Goal

Over time, players should internalize a different relationship to cost.

Not:
> “How much did this cost me?”

But:
> “How much of myself did I put into this Prince?”

Monetization should fade as meaning deepens.

---

## Final Constraint

> **If money ever becomes more visible than the Prince,
> the game has failed its own premise.**

Monetization exists to support the world—not to explain it.
