## Think / Wait / Fast — Core Player Actions

### Motivation

Space Prince intentionally limits the player’s action space to preserve meaning, legibility, and expressive depth. Rather than offering a large set of tactical verbs, the game defines **three existential stances** a Prince may take toward any moment:

> **Think. Wait. Fast.**

These are not abilities in the conventional sense. They are orientations toward uncertainty, time, and constraint. All other mechanics—planetary actions, elemental dynamics, and progression effects—are interpreted through one of these three stances.

This structure reinforces:
- One meaningful action per turn
- Ritual pacing over reflex
- Expression over optimization
- Attention as the primary resource

---

### Action Overview

On each turn, the player may choose exactly one of the following actions:

- **Think** — seek clarity
- **Wait** — yield to time
- **Fast** — impose constraint

Each action must always produce a **legible effect**, even if its full consequences are delayed.

### Think

**Philosophical Stance:**
Attention directed inward.

**Design Intent:**
Thinking trades tempo for clarity. It allows the Prince to better understand the forces currently acting upon them, at the cost of momentum.

**Mechanical Characteristics (Illustrative):**
- Reveals additional information about the current state
- Surfaces modifiers, tendencies, or likely outcome bands
- Allows reinterpretation or reframing of a planetary action
- May reduce variance or make outcomes more predictable

**Constraints:**
- Does not advance the encounter
- Often cedes initiative
- Overuse may lead to stagnation or missed opportunities

**Interpretive Frame:**
Thinking is not optimization; it is orientation. It can prevent catastrophic misunderstanding, but it does not guarantee safety.

### Wait

**Philosophical Stance:**
Attention withheld.

**Design Intent:**
Waiting allows the world to act first. It emphasizes patience, endurance, and responsiveness over control.

**Mechanical Characteristics (Illustrative):**
- Skips or delays the Prince’s initiative
- Allows opposing forces or environmental effects to resolve
- May accumulate subtle contextual modifiers
- Can trigger alternative lore fragments or world responses

**Constraints:**
- Increases exposure to risk
- Outcomes may become harder to influence
- Excessive waiting can be mistaken for safety

**Interpretive Frame:**
Waiting is not inaction. It is a deliberate refusal to intervene, with consequences that unfold regardless of intent.

---

### Fast

**Philosophical Stance:**
Attention concentrated through deprivation.

**Design Intent:**
Fasting imposes voluntary constraint in exchange for intensity. It is the most dangerous and most decisive stance.

**Mechanical Characteristics (Illustrative):**
- Temporarily suppresses or sacrifices a resource, planet, or option
- Amplifies the impact of a subsequent action
- Forces resolution rather than deferral
- Often increases variance and risk

**Constraints:**
- Costs cannot be immediately recovered
- Misuse can accelerate failure
- Repeated fasting may permanently shape the Prince’s trajectory

**Interpretive Frame:**
Fasting is not aggression. It is commitment—the choice to narrow possibility in order to force meaning.

---

### Design Invariants

- Every turn offers **Think, Wait, or Fast**—never more, never less
- No action is “free”; each alters state or probability
- No action is purely cosmetic
- No optimal sequence exists independent of context
- Silence and restraint are valid forms of play

Planetary abilities, elemental interactions, and special mechanics are expressed **through** these stances, not alongside them.

---

### Lore Alignment

Lore fragments may explicitly or implicitly reference these stances:

- Those who think may survive longer, but arrive later
- Those who wait may endure, but are shaped by what they allow
- Those who fast may understand sooner, or disappear entirely

These are not metaphors. They are mechanically true.

*The Prince does not choose what happens.
They choose how they meet what happens.*
