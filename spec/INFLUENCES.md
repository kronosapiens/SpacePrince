# Space Prince — Influences & Contrasts

Space Prince is informed by a wide range of games, genres, and systems, but it does not attempt to replicate any of them. This document clarifies how specific influences shaped the project — and where Space Prince deliberately diverges.

The guiding question throughout is not “what did we like?” but:

> **What problem did this influence solve — and how are we solving it differently?**

---

## Diablo (ARPG Lineage)

### What We Take

- The fantasy of inhabiting **a single character over time**
- Combat as the primary mode of world interaction
- Distinct playstyles that feel embodied, not abstract
- The sense that a character has a *personality* expressed through mechanics

### What We Reject

- Gear-driven power inflation
- Build invalidation through patches or meta shifts
- Endless loot churn
- Power scaling that trivializes earlier content

### How Space Prince Differs

Space Prince replaces *gear accumulation* with **interpretive depth**.
Power does not come from acquiring better items, but from understanding how a fixed identity can express itself under different constraints.

Where Diablo asks:
> “What did you find?”

Space Prince asks:
> “What did you realize?”

## Hades (Roguelike Structure & Narrative Progression)

### What We Take

- Failure as forward motion
- World and narrative progression gated by death
- Short, repeatable runs that encourage experimentation
- Characters and systems that reveal themselves over time

### What We Reject

- Rapid action execution and reflex dominance
- Heavy reliance on player dexterity
- Centralized authored narrative arcs

### How Space Prince Differs

Hades uses death to advance a *story about a character*.
Space Prince uses death to advance a *cosmology around the player*.

The world doesn’t just unlock new dialogue — it changes mechanically in response to how the player fails. Death is less “try again” and more “the universe took note.”

## Traditional Roguelikes (NetHack, Slay the Spire, etc.)

### What We Take

- Meaningful randomness
- Risk as a core experiential driver
- Replayability through recombination, not content exhaustion
- Clear cause-and-effect relationships

### What We Reject

- Disposable characters
- Optimal-path dominance
- Restart-as-forgetfulness

### How Space Prince Differs

Traditional roguelikes assume characters are *meant to die*.
Space Prince assumes characters are *meant to persist*.

Runs are temporary, but identity is permanent. Loss does not erase history; it writes it.

---

## Tabletop RPGs (D&D, OSR, etc.)

### What We Take

- The symbolic power of the D20
- Explicit, visible randomness
- Ritualized action resolution
- Player reasoning about probability rather than reacting to hidden math

### What We Reject

- Arbitrary GM fiat
- Excessive rules layering
- Character sheets as optimization puzzles

### How Space Prince Differs

In tabletop RPGs, randomness is moderated by a human arbiter.
In Space Prince, randomness is moderated by **identity**.

Astrology shapes probability, variance, and risk profiles. The question is never “what did I roll?” but:
> “Given who I am, how did this tend to go?”

---

## Astrology (Symbolic System, Not Belief System)

### What We Take

- A dense symbolic language
- Cyclical balance
- Orthogonal axes of differentiation
- Non-hierarchical typology

### What We Reject

- Truth claims
- Predictive authority
- Real-world belief enforcement

### How Space Prince Differs

Astrology is used as a **design substrate**, not a worldview.

It provides:
- A fixed but expressive identity space
- Meaningful asymmetry without dominance
- Narrative resonance without canonized interpretation

The game does not assert astrology is true — only that it is *useful*.

---

## Onchain Games & Crypto-Native Design

### What We Take

- Deterministic, auditable game logic
- Persistence and canonical state
- Player ownership of identity
- Resistance to opaque server authority

### What We Reject

- Speculation-first design
- Tokenized power escalation
- “Number-go-up” incentives
- Play-to-earn framing

### How Space Prince Differs

Space Prince treats the chain as **canon**, not backend infrastructure.

Everything that matters:
- Identity
- World state
- Combat resolution
- Memory

…is onchain. The client merely reveals what already exists.

---

## What Space Prince Is *Not*

Space Prince is not:
- A TCG
- A hero collector
- A loot treadmill
- An esports title
- A belief-driven astrology simulator

It is not about mastery over systems, but **coherence within constraint**.

---

## Summary

Space Prince stands at the intersection of:
- ARPG embodiment
- Roguelike progression
- Tabletop ritual
- Symbolic systems
- Onchain finality

But it diverges from each influence at the exact point where **optimization would overwhelm meaning**.

> Where other games ask you to become stronger,
> Space Prince asks you to become more precise.

---

*Influence is not about resemblance.
It is about shared pressure — and different answers.*
