# Space Prince — Influences & Contrasts

Space Prince is informed by a wide range of games, genres, and systems, but it does not attempt to replicate any of them. This document clarifies how specific influences shaped the project — and where Space Prince deliberately diverges.

The guiding question throughout is not “what did we like?” but:

> **What problem did this influence solve — and how are we solving it differently?**

---

## Diablo (ARPG Lineage)

### What We Take

- The fantasy of inhabiting **a single character over time**
- Combat as the primary mode of world interaction
- Distinct playstyles that feel embodied, not abstract
- The sense that a character has a *personality* expressed through mechanics

### What We Reject

- Gear-driven power inflation
- Build invalidation through patches or meta shifts
- Endless loot churn
- Power scaling that trivializes earlier content

### How Space Prince Differs

Space Prince replaces *gear accumulation* with **interpretive depth**.
Power does not come from acquiring better items, but from understanding how a fixed identity can express itself under different constraints.

Where Diablo asks:
> “What did you find?”

Space Prince asks:
> “What did you realize?”

## Hades (Roguelike Structure & Narrative Progression)

### What We Take

- Failure as forward motion
- World and narrative progression gated by death
- Short, repeatable runs that encourage experimentation
- Characters and systems that reveal themselves over time

### What We Reject

- Rapid action execution and reflex dominance
- Heavy reliance on player dexterity
- Centralized authored narrative arcs

### How Space Prince Differs

Hades uses death to advance a *story about a character*.
Space Prince uses death to advance a *cosmology around the player*.

The world doesn’t just unlock new dialogue — it changes mechanically in response to how the player fails. Death is less “try again” and more “the universe took note.”

---

## Traditional Roguelikes (NetHack, Slay the Spire, etc.)

### What We Take

- Meaningful randomness
- Risk as a core experiential driver
- Replayability through recombination, not content exhaustion
- Clear cause-and-effect relationships

### What We Reject

- Disposable characters
- Optimal-path dominance
- Restart-as-forgetfulness

### How Space Prince Differs

Traditional roguelikes assume characters are *meant to die*.
Space Prince assumes characters are *meant to persist*.

Runs are temporary, but identity is permanent. Loss does not erase history; it writes it.

---

## Tabletop RPGs (D&D, OSR, etc.)

### What We Take

- The symbolic power of the D20
- Explicit, visible randomness
- Ritualized action resolution
- Player reasoning about probability rather than reacting to hidden math

### What We Reject

- Arbitrary GM fiat
- Excessive rules layering
- Character sheets as optimization puzzles

### How Space Prince Differs

In tabletop RPGs, randomness is moderated by a human arbiter.
In Space Prince, randomness is moderated by **identity**.

Astrology shapes probability, variance, and risk profiles. The question is never “what did I roll?” but:
> “Given who I am, how did this tend to go?”

---

## Astrology (Symbolic System, Not Belief System)

### What We Take

- A dense symbolic language
- Cyclical balance
- Orthogonal axes of differentiation
- Non-hierarchical typology

### What We Reject

- Truth claims
- Predictive authority
- Real-world belief enforcement

### How Space Prince Differs

Astrology is used as a **design substrate**, not a worldview.

It provides:
- A fixed but expressive identity space
- Meaningful asymmetry without dominance
- Narrative resonance without canonized interpretation

The game does not assert astrology is true — only that it is *useful*.

---

## Onchain Games & Crypto-Native Design

### What We Take

- Deterministic, auditable game logic
- Persistence and canonical state
- Player ownership of identity
- Resistance to opaque server authority

### What We Reject

- Speculation-first design
- Tokenized power escalation
- “Number-go-up” incentives
- Play-to-earn framing

### How Space Prince Differs

Space Prince treats the chain as **canon**, not backend infrastructure.

Everything that matters:
- Identity
- World state
- Combat resolution
- Memory

…is onchain. The client merely reveals what already exists.

---

## FTL: Faster Than Light (Strategic Roguelike)

### What We Take

- Resource scarcity as a forcing function for hard choices
- Node-based progression through a hostile world
- Encounter diversity without content bloat
- The feeling that every decision carries weight because nothing regenerates freely

### What We Reject

- Real-time pressure and pause-spam optimization
- Crew micromanagement
- Ship unlocks as the primary metaprogression reward
- Power fantasy through better loadouts

### How Space Prince Differs

FTL creates tension through **scarcity and pursuit**.
Space Prince creates tension through **constraint and interpretation**.

In FTL, you are always running out of something — fuel, missiles, hull.
In Space Prince, you are never "out" of anything; you are simply no longer permitted to act in certain ways.

Where FTL asks:
> "Can you survive long enough to win?"

Space Prince asks:
> "Can you understand yourself well enough to continue?"

## Loot Survivor (Onchain Roguelike)

### What We Take

- Fully onchain game state with no backend authority
- Verifiable randomness as a first-class design element
- Turn-based combat that respects blockchain constraints
- Proof that meaningful roguelike gameplay can exist onchain

### What We Reject

- Stat-driven power accumulation
- Gear tiers and item farming
- Numeric optimization as the core loop
- Combat as the sole mode of engagement

### How Space Prince Differs

Loot Survivor demonstrates that onchain roguelikes are viable.
Space Prince asks what an onchain roguelike looks like when **identity replaces inventory**.

Loot Survivor's adventurers are defined by what they find and equip.
Space Prince's Princes are defined by what they are and how they fail.

Where Loot Survivor asks:
> "What gear did you acquire?"

Space Prince asks:
> "What did the world permit you to become?"

Both games treat the chain as canon.
But Loot Survivor uses the chain to verify *accumulation*.
Space Prince uses the chain to verify *transformation*.

## Additional Inspirations

The following offer relevant design and thematic lessons.

### Siddhartha (Hermann Hesse)

The core narrative influence.
A Prince's journey is Siddhartha's journey: self-discovery through experience, not instruction.

**Key themes:**
- Wisdom cannot be taught, only lived into
- There are no shortcuts — understanding requires experience
- Failure and suffering are teachers
- The journey has no destination; the point is becoming
- Returning to the same things with deeper comprehension

**The Action Space:**

The **Think / Wait / Fast** actions come directly from Siddhartha's answer to the merchant Kamaswami:

> *"I can think. I can wait. I can fast."*

**The River:**

Siddhartha's deepest teacher is the river — not a person, but a presence he listens to over years.
The cosmos in Space Prince functions the same way: not an opponent to defeat, but a world to harmonize with.
Alignment isn't conquest; it's listening.

**Partial Teachers:**

Siddhartha learns from many teachers — Samanas, Gotama, Kamala, Kamaswami, Vasudeva — but none gives him the whole truth.
The planets are partial teachers: Saturn teaches restriction, Mars teaches commitment, Mercury teaches misdirection.
A Prince who only listens to one planet learns something, but not everything.

**Govinda's Parallel Path:**

Siddhartha's friend Govinda follows Buddha directly; Siddhartha wanders.
They meet again at the end — two paths, neither wrong.
Other Princes are Govinda: different coordinates, different journeys, no judgment about which is better.

**The Om:**

At the end, Siddhartha hears the Om — the unity beneath all apparent opposition.
This is the Fixed Stars layer: where distinctions collapse into facets of one thing.

This is why the game has no tutorial, why death advances understanding, and why there is no win screen.

### Into the Breach

Turn-based tactics with perfect information — you see exactly what enemies will do before you act.
Tension emerges from puzzle-like constraints, not hidden odds.
Relevant for legible randomness and weighty single actions.

### Cultist Simulator

Uses a symbolic system (aspects, elements, seasons) as actual mechanics, not flavor.
Lore is fragmented and discovered through play.
No tutorial, no clear win state.
Mythic tone without being self-serious.

### Outer Wilds

Progress is purely knowledge — you can't grind, can't upgrade, can't accumulate.
Death resets position but not understanding.
The purest expression of "interpretive progress."

### Wildermyth

Procedural myth-making.
Characters age, scar, transform, and their history gets written into them permanently.
Deaths become legends.
A model for how a Prince's history could become narrative.

### Disco Elysium

Fixed identity as constraint — you are this specific person with this specific past.
Failure is often more interesting than success.
The skill system is psychological and philosophical, not tactical.

## Summary

Space Prince stands at the intersection of:
- ARPG embodiment
- Roguelike progression
- Tabletop ritual
- Symbolic systems
- Strategic scarcity
- Onchain finality
- Journey narrative (Siddhartha)

But it diverges from each influence at the exact point where **optimization would overwhelm meaning**.

> Where other games ask you to become stronger,
> Space Prince asks you to become more precise.

---

*Influence is not about resemblance.
It is about shared pressure — and different answers.*
